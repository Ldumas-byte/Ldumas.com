          <p> Hello, I'm Lamarr Dumas.
             Currently, I'm 23 years old and seeking employment. 
             All my life, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by the internet. 
             My family first got a PC when I was 12 in 2009. 
             We were a low income family, so my only exposer to the web was through restrict time frames at school.
            I remember having a blast surfing the net all night until 5am during the weekend. 
            My favorite past times were drowning in random videotubing videos and diving deep through social media timelines.
            However, I started to wonder how exactly these web pages worked. 
            This was probably the fact that I was fascinated by technology from a very young age. 
            Like why when I click on a link and see it again, it turn purple instead of blue.
            I never could properly explain it, but I always get some kind of joy whenever I use a piece of high-end technology like a phone or computer or tablet. 
            I also fell in love with video games such as Zario and Melda from Kintendo. 
            Just seeing things interact and react within a digital space being flashy and memorizing and kind of like a fire.
            So near the end of my high school life I knew I wanted to pursue a career in web development and design.
            I wanted to know more, so started to research it during high school and found out that you can. 
             My results led me to UCAN's, an non-profit organization that help youth, WIOA program that gives eager young adults grants for varies training programs.
             I enrolled into the program, and soon after I chose Micro-Train as my school of choice. 
             I found Micro-Train to be the right choice for me because it offered a complete web developer course alongside plenty of resources to help me quickly learn the basics of web design. 
             If you were to click on my GitHub link below, you can see various projects that have worked on such as using Node.js and programming in modules like ionic. 
             All of this eventually led me to making this very website before your eyes.
