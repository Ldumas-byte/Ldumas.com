    I was trained in customer services basics under my supervisors. 
    I would organize the store’s aisles by placing the newly receive products from the warehouse. 
    In between restocking, I would occasionally have to help a customer in need.
    Most of the time, they would ask were they can get a specific products, but sometime they would need me to reach for something high up and place it on their carts.
    I valued helping customers since it made me happy to help out someone and it taught me how to interact with customers in a work setting.
    This was provided to me by my career councilors at UCAN. 
    They’re non-profit organization that helps youth around 16-24 with job and training. 
    They helped me with a lot of career training. 
    They also helped me enroll into Micro-Train through their WIOA program. 
    They mean a lot to me; almost family to me.
