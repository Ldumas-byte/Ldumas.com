            My name is Lamarr Dumas. I am writing you to express my sincere interest in applying for the position your company is seeking to fill.  I’m confident that my customer service experience and professional skill set is exactly what you’re looking for in a candidate. I am a former college student who recently got their Basic certificate in Medical Billing from Malcolm X College during spring 2019. I enjoy learning; however, I decided to put attending school on hold, for a while, to focus more on finding variable work experience.
            My highlighted soft skills include;
                • Experience being patient employee who is willing to adapt to my work environment. 
                • Understanding how strict business environments.
                •  Holding specialize skills like sorting papers, storing files, and multitasking.
            At your convenience I would like to meet with a representative from your company to further discuss my skills and knowledge.
